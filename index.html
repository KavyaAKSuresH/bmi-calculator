  <h2> Weight Gain Tips</h2>

  <p>
    In today’s world, where so many people are battling being overweight, it may seem odd that someone would purposefully want to gain weight.  
    But the fact is that being underweight can be as damaging as being overweight. People need a certain amount of fat in the body in order for 
    their body to work correctly and being underweight can lead to brittle bones, a weakened immune system, anemia, fertility issues and hair loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re underweight due to genetics, your lifestyle or an illness, there are things you can do to add back some of those pounds in a 
    healthy manner. In the end, your body should be semi-lean and toned with a healthy glow.
  </p>

  <h3>How to Put on Weight</h3>

  </p>

    Yet for those who stay consistent, the end result is always worth it.
  </p>
